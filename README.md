Hi, I'm Ben, a professional software engineer.  
At work I develop a lot of backend services for financial purposes and help with the devops side.  
For fun I chip away at a personal website thats not quite ready to take out of the oven yet.  
I try to learn new things everyday about a lot of different topics such as cooking, sports, and arts!
